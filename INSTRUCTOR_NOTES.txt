# Quick Instructor Notes

## Pre-Class Setup (5 min)
1. Provision EC2 instances (one per student)
2. Distribute SSH keys
3. Test one deployment yourself
4. Have OpenAI keys ready

## Class Flow (90 min)

### Introduction (10 min)
- Explain what we're building
- Show final result
- Discuss use cases

### Hands-On Deployment (55 min)
- Students follow SETUP.md
- Walk through steps together
- Help with troubleshooting

### Testing & Exploration (15 min)
- Run test_api.sh
- Explore Swagger UI
- Try custom queries

### Wrap-Up (10 min)
- Q&A
- Discuss extensions
- Share resources

## Common Questions

Q: "Can I use this in production?"
A: Yes, but add: SSL, rate limiting, monitoring, backups

Q: "How much will this cost?"
A: ~$35/month for EC2 + OpenAI usage (~$0.01-0.05 per conversation)

Q: "Can I modify the code?"
A: Absolutely! It's yours. Check src/ directory.

Q: "What if OpenAI is down?"
A: API will still run, but embeddings/search won't work

## Success Metrics
- All students deploy successfully
- Everyone can add & search memories
- Students understand the architecture
- Can explain vector vs relational DBs

## Cleanup After Class
sudo docker stop mem0_api mem0_qdrant
sudo docker rm mem0_api mem0_qdrant
# OR terminate EC2 instances

## Cost
Per student: ~$0.10 for 2-hour lab
Class of 30: ~$3.00 total

## Files Students Need
- README.md (overview)
- SETUP.md (deployment steps)
- API.md (endpoint reference)
- test_api.sh (testing)
- All code files (src/, deployment/, requirements.txt, .env.template)

## Files YOU Need
